The code to generate the [video](https://youtu.be/rI2yBMnZMpU) I made to explain space weather and the solar wind. This was made with [ManimCE](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/) v.0.10.0 and was edited together with Blender.

Thanks to the whole Manim community and especially [TheoremofBeethoven](https://github.com/Elteoremadebeethoven) for their tutorials.
