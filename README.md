# Animations

Code for animations I have made, which can be seen on my [website](https://www.ronanlaker.com/animations/).

1. Parker Solar Probe Co-rotation: Inspired by [@matthen2's](https://twitter.com/matthen2/) animation of Cruithne. I adapted his Mathematica code for Parker Solar Probe's orbit around the Sun to demonstrate how it "co-rotates".
2. [What is the Solar Wind and why should you care?](https://youtu.be/rI2yBMnZMpU): I made this animation for the Faculty of Natural Science [Showcase 2021](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/natural-sciences/research/showcases-seminars/2021/). I used [ManimCE](https://www.manim.community/) which is based on Grant Sanderson's excellent [Manim code](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).
