# [Interactive Orbits](https://www.ronanlaker.com/vis/orbits)

A reference [figure](https://www.ronanlaker.com/vis/orbits) for spacecraft orbits in the inner heliosphere. Made with [Plotly](https://plotly.com/), so it is zoomable and spacecraft can be added or removed by the user.
I have used [astrospice](https://pypi.org/project/astrospice/) and [Spiceypy](https://spiceypy.readthedocs.io/en/main/) to load the SPICE kernels required to plot the orbits.

I have included the following spacecraft:

- Parker Solar Probe
- Solar Orbiter
- BepiColombo
- Earth (which is close enough for Wind, ACE and DSCOVR)
- STEREO-A

I am not massively keen on the colour scheme, so if anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them.
